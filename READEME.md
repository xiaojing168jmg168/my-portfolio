As a job seeker.
I want to show my portfolio to my employer.
So that they can review samples ot my work and assess whether I am a good candidate for their open position.

When they load my portfolio. Then my name and photo are presented. and links to sections about my work and how to contact me. 

When they move their mouse to the navigation. Evey link have hover on it.

When they click on the link in the navigation, then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

When they click on the link to the section about my work. Then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications.

My first image of application is larger in size than the others.

When they click on the images of the applications, Then take them to that deployed application.

when they resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices. Then my site is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport.
